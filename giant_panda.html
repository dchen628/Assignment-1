        Giant pandas are black and white and loved all over.
        The giant panda is a national treasure in China and is therefore protected by law in its bamboo forest home.
        This unique bear has long been revered and can be found in Chinese art dating back thousands of years.
        The Chinese call the beloved pandas large bear-cats.
        Giant pandas have also fascinated people living outside of China; French Missionary Pere Armand David first described them for science in 1869.
        Now, more than 100 years later, the worldwide love for pandas has been combined with international conservation efforts.
