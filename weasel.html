        Weasel, any of various small carnivores with very elongated slender bodies.
        Most live in the Northern Hemisphere and belong to the genus Mustela, which in addition to weasels proper includes 17 species of ferrets and polecats as well as the mink and the ermine.
        Along with their tubelike bodies, weasels have small flattened heads, long flexible necks, and short limbs.
        The fur is short but dense, and the slim tail is pointed at the tip.
        Five toes on each foot end in sharp curved claws. The species can be differentiated by size, colour, and relative length of the tail.
